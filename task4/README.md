# Task 4 Scientific Web Discourse

Task 4 consists of two subtasks:

- **Subtask 4a (Scientific Web Discourse Detection):** Given a social media post (tweet), detect if it contains (1) a scientific claim, (2) a reference to a scientific study / publication, or (3) mentions of scientific entities, e.g. a university or scientist.<br><br>
- **Subtask 4b (Scientific Claim Source Retrieval):** Given an implicit reference to a scientific paper, i.e., a social media post (tweet) that mentions a research publication without a URL, retrieve the mentioned paper from a pool of candidate papers.
