                    "the hours of early voting have been a contentious political issue for years, with state legislators across the country seeking to expand or restrict the times and locations that election administrators are allowed to use. for instance, in 2011, floridas republican-controlled state legislature reduced the days and hours of early voting in that state, in a move that was widely criticized by voting rights advocates as disenfranchising voters. a report by scholars at dartmouth college and the university of florida found that the change resulted in 225,000 fewer in-person early votes being cast in the 2012 presidential election. in 2013, then-governor rick scott, a republican who had supported the 2011 law, shifted gears and endorsed legislation to increase the early voting hours at each polling location from 96 to 168. in new york city and elsewhere, early voting was plagued by multi-hour lines. there is no place in the united states of america where two, three, four hour waits to vote is acceptable, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez said at a press conference in late october, calling it a form of voter suppression. a landmark 2014 presidential commission on election administration report determined that no voter should wait longer than 30 minutes; anything longer is a hurdle to participation.",
                    "we use the terms in-person early voting and early voting and analyses below. 6. this belief affects attitudes toward other election laws, with republicans",
                    "consistent with prior years, gallup finds early voting is most popular among voters living in the western u.s., with nearly two-thirds of western residents, 65%, planning to vote early. western states have longer histories than other states in extending early voting opportunities, with many allowing voting weeks before election day and oregon conducting its elections entirely by mail. more people in the south (41%) than in the east (28%) and midwest (28%) intend to vote before election day. early voting intentions this year, though more prevalent than in the last (2018) midterm election, match those from the 2016 presidential election (40%). the level of planned early voting measured in the oct. 3-20 poll still does not reach what gallup measured in the 2020 presidential election year, during the coronavirus pandemic and before covid-19 vaccines were available. two years ago, 64% of u.s. registered voters planned to vote early versus 32% who planned to vote on election day. it is unclear how much pandemic concerns boosted early voting in 2020 because the practice has historically been more common in presidential than in midterm election years."

                    "following the passage of arizona's (now mostly defunct) s.b. 1070, a growing number of states followed suit. legislators in at least five states have introduced laws mirroring the arizona immigration law. those states include: immigration laws and policies are federal. as a result, the arizona immigration law was challenged as violating the supremacy clause. the u.s. 9th circuit court of appeals upheld a lower federal court's injunction of the law, kicking the matter up to the u.s. supreme court. many national immigration reform advocates hoped the controversy surrounding arizona's law would help emphasize the need for a comprehensive federal reform law. but such reform has yet to be introduced. while many legal challenges have resulted from the bill, many deficiencies remain within the u.s. immigration system.",
                    "as a result of the bill, arizona has gotten far more attention across the u.s. about whether its immigration policies are too harsh. for example, law enforcement officials in the state have been under increased public scrutiny since the passage of sb 1070. opponents of these policies argue that they give law enforcement an excuse to over-penalize noncitizens for minor crimes. arizona senate bill 1070 is one of the toughest immigration laws in the united states. but a 2012 u.s. supreme court ruling whittled the law down significantly. a 2016 settlement between arizona and immigrants' rights groups affected its use as well. the supreme court of the united states upheld the legal arizona workers act over legal challenges. these challenges claim that the law ran afoul of federal immigration laws. the supreme court ruled that arizona's law fell within the authority left to the states by congress on the subject."

                    "applying this guideline to trumps speech, its pretty clear that she plagiarized from obamas speech. not only are there chunks of seven or more exact words, but the context and the sentence structure are nearly identical. last nights republican national convention has thrust plagiarism to the forefront of the news. one of last nights speakers was melania trump, the wife of presumptive republican presidential nominee donald j. trump. trumps speech sounded to many strikingly similar to one given eight years earlierby first lady michelle obama at the democratic national convention in 2008. donald trumps campaign has said that trump did not plagiarize her speech. in fact, trump earlier had told matt lauer from the today show that she wrote it herself, which raises an interesting point. trump is from slovenia. different cultures view the borrowing of words or ideas differently; in some of those cultures, a writer might be expected to give word-for-word recitations in speech or writing. i dont know if slovenia is one of those cultures. but i do know that here, at elite political levels, there are (or should be) professionals whose job it is to write (or rewrite) speeches, and if those people werent involved in trumps speech, they should have been."

                    "the facebook post claims melania trump removed the roses planted by her predecessors going back to 1913. thats wrong. over the years, roses have both died and been replaced as different administrations have left their mark on the white house rose garden. only about a dozen rose bushes remained before this most recent renovation. drawing from sources like newspaper articles and contemporaneous accounts, the rose garden landscape report lists 58 different roses that have been grown at the white house over the years, from the cleveland administration to the obama administration. the first documented, large scale plan of roses planted in the garden dates back to the truman administration in 1952. there isnt even a definitive rose planting plan for the kennedy rose garden, according to the report, and records are scarce for plantings in the years after until the carter administration. that was when the national park service started producing reports listing changes to the white house grounds and gardens, including the roses grown and their location in the garden. first lady ellen wilson planted a rose garden in 1913, but its official name at the time is unclear, according to the white house rose garden landscape report published this year by the committee for the preservation of the white house. in the second half of the century, \"rose garden\" started to appear more frequently, but it was used interchangeably with \"west garden.\" the rose garden that americans are familiar with today reflects the 1962 design of rachel lambert mellon, who was approached by president john f. kennedy to help renew the space after he was inspired by the gardens he saw at official residences on a state visit to europe.",

                    "conspiracy theorists have long pointed to the collapse of the 47-story structure as key evidence that the u.s. government orchestrated or abetted the 9/11 attacks. no planes struck the building, and the commonly available views of the exterior didn't show significant damage. yet, at 5:20 pm, 7 hours after the collapse of the twin towers (wtc 1 and 2), wtc 7 rapidly fell in on itself. since wtc 7 housed secret service and cia offices, conspiracy theorists claimed that the building was destroyed in a controlled demolition in order to obliterate evidence of the u.s. government's complicity in the terrorist attacks. \"it is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved,\" stated actress and tv personality rosie o'donnell of abc's the view in march 2007. \"for the first time in history, steel was melted by fire. it is physically impossible,\" she said.",
                    "all three buildings collapsed in a manner that indicated controlled demolition. this is a sophisticated operation and not many companies have the capability to achieve the desired results. building-7 in particular, the 47-storey, 186-meter high building was not hit by any plane. it collapsed in 6.5 seconds and imploded inward. this could only be the work of controlled demolition with explosives placed at strategic points. fire fighters and others that were in the twin towers and survived the ordeal have reported hearing explosions before the buildings collapsed. these reinforce the controlled demolition allegation. not surprisingly, a clear majority of people outside the us does not subscribe to the official version of 9/11. nor indeed do many families of the victims of 9/11. but it is the collapse of three, not two buildings that has aroused the greatest degree of skepticism. after all, only two planes hit the world trade centre towers; so how did building no. 7, a 47-storey building collapse, the way it did when no plane had slammed into it? the official explanation that fire caused so much damage that it collapsed, does not stand up to scrutiny."

(for the purposes of this analysis, we define the states baseline budget as the ongoing program spending level after removing all onetime and temporary spending the administration estimates is currently authorized or planned under governors budget. for the purposes of this analysis, we also assumed the state would suspend its annual deposits into the states constitutional reserve.) as shown in figure 2, using the likely range of plausible revenue outcomes, we find the chances the state can afford the baseline budget are roughly even. specifically, there are even chances (one in two) that revenues would be sufficient for the state to pay for all of its baseline programs. as we have outlined before, relying on a revenue estimate that presents even chances of a surplus and a deficit helps the state avoid making commitments it cannot sustain while also not foregoing program expansions that likely can be supported. governors budget likely unaffordable in future years. under the administrations projections, the state faces operating deficits of $9 billion in 202425, $9 billion in 202526, and $4 billion in 202627. because of the states constitutional spending requirements, revenues would need to be higher by more than these amounts for the state to be able to afford the spending level currently proposed. for example, to eliminate the operating deficit in 202425, revenues would need to be roughly $20 billion higher than the governors budget projection. our analysis suggests this level of revenue is quite unlikelythere is only a oneinfive chance the state can afford that spending level.",

                    "the amount of student debt in 2020 totaled nearly $1.6 trillion, more than twice the amount outstanding in 2008 ($600 billion). that growth in debt significantly exceeds the increase in the number of students, which the department of education estimates has only risen by 2 percent among undergraduates and by 12 percent at the graduate level. one major reason for the significant rise in student debt is that more americans are borrowing to attend college. the percentage of households with student debt has almost tripled, from 8 percent in 1989 to 21 percent in 2019. that trend is true for younger households as well; the prevalence of student debt for those households has climbed from 15 percent in 1989 to 41 percent in 2019. student debt may affect the economic outlook for americans.",
                    "the decades-long increase in student debt is even more noticeable when compared to decades prior. in quarter three of 2010, americans owed roughly $845 billion in student loans which means that u.s. student debt has increased by approximately 102% in the past decade. and as college students across the country pivoted between on-campus and remote learning, 2020 was also the year the united states surpassed owing over $1.7 trillion in student debt for the first time. the federal reserve estimates that in quarter three of 2020, americans owed more than $1.7 trillion in student loans  an increase of nearly 4% compared to quarter three of 2019."

                    "the reserve bank of india (rbi) decided to withdraw rs 2000 from circulation. as per the notification issued by the rbi, the rs 2,000 note is being taken out of circulation in pursuance of the clean note policy. the central bank has asked people to exchange or deposit the rs 2,000 note in banks by september 30, 2023. the rbi has stressed the fact that rs 2000 note continues to be a legal tender . this means that one can use the rs 2000 note for buying goods and services, in everyday life transactions etc. however, nothing is mentioned in the latest circular regarding what will happen if rs 2000 note is not exchanged or deposited in banks by the september 30 deadlinein a media interaction on may 22, 2023, rbi governor shaktikanta das said that procedural elements post-september 30, 2023 deadline or possible deadline extension will be taken based on the number of rs 2000 notes that come back from circulation.the rbi in its directive to all banks has said that the instructions for the modalities of exchange and deposit of rs 2000 note are effective till september 30, 2023. thus, one needs to await further instructions from rbi regarding what will happen to these notes from october 1, 2023.the rbi can provide a facility of exchange of rs 2000 notes even after september 30, 2023, via a new circular, if it deems fit, as it was done in the case of withdrawal of pre-2005 notes done in 2013-14 (as mentioned below).as of now, by virtue of being a legal tender, as stated by rbi, the rs 2000 notes can still be exchanged after 30 september 2023, at the specified rbi offices. that window is open for all, in case you miss depositing or exchanging at the bank.if rbi deems fit and issues an updated circular, it can allow an individual to deposit rs 2000 banknotes in their bank accounts, even after 30 sept 2023.also read: when can you deposit rs 2000 notes in bank? here are two instances of what happened in earlier times when rbi withdrew currency - notes and coins- from circulation.in 2013-14, the rbi decided to withdraw some banknotes issued prior to 2005 from circulation. this was done because such notes had fewer security features and new ones with better security features were available.the faqs issued by the rbi on indian currency (updated till may 17, 2022), state that the facility for exchange of pre-2005 notes is available in specified offices of rbi. however, this does not imply that banks cannot accept deposits of pre-2005 banknotes for crediting the money to the customers account. this has been reiterated by the rbi in a press release dated december 19, 2016.hence, going by rbis above-mentioned faqs, if an individual has an old pre-2005 bank note for a denomination of say rs 10, 50, or 100, then such notes can either be deposited in their bank accounts or exchanged at the specified rbi offices. however, do note that old rs 500 and rs 1000 notes can neither be exchanged nor deposited in the bank account. this is because these notes were demonetised and ceased to be legal tender from midnight of november 8, 2016.also read: is there a limit on amount of rs 2000 note that can be deposited, exchange? the central bank has done a similar exercise in the case of 25 paise coins. the same faqs as mentioned above state: twenty five paise coins were withdrawn from circulation with effect from june 30, 2011, andcoins of denominations below 25 paise were withdrawn from circulation much earlier. all other denominations of coins of various size, theme and design minted by government of india under the coinage act, 2011 and issued by rbi for circulation from time to time, continue to remain legal tender.as per the faqs, every banknote issued by reserve bank of india (rs 2, rs 5, rs 10, rs 20, rs 50, rs 100, rs 200, rs 500 and rs 2000), unless withdrawn from circulation, shall be legal tender at any place in india in payment or on account for the amount expressed therein, and shall be guaranteed by the central government, subject to provisions of sub-section (2) section 26 of rbi act, 1934.the press note issued by the rbi on may 19, 2023, says that though rs 2000 note is being withdrawn from circulation, it continues to be a legal tender. members of the public can continue to use rs 2000 banknotes for their transactions and also receive them in payment. however, theydeposit and/or exchange these banknotes on or before september 30, 2023, state the faqs issued for the deposit/exchange of rs 2000 notes.the language used by rbi encouraged to does not make it clear what will happen after september 30. in the two instances cited above, as per rbis own faqs while 25 paise coin is no longer legal tender, the pre-2005 banknotes continue to be so.also read: what will happen if bank spots fake rs 2000 note hence, it would be wise to follow the rbis guidelines and exchange/deposit rs 2000 notes in banks by september 30.",

                    "in 1916, the us government predicted that all paper would come from hemp by the 1940s, and plans were underway to implement this. quality paints and varnishes were made from hemp seed oil until 1937, and henry ford's first model-t was built to run on hemp gasoline and constructed from hemp plastic, which was 10 times stronger than steel. hemp has a rich history of use for various purposes in many cultures for thousands of years. it was widely used in colonial america, and many of the founding fathers, including george washington and thomas jefferson, grew hemp. in the late 1800s and early 1900s, hemp was the largest cash crop in america, producing 80% of all textiles, fabrics, and linen. the u.s. government predicted that by the 1940s, all paper would come from hemp, and that trees would no longer need to be cut down. furthermore, innovations in farm machinery in the 1930s could have caused an industrial revolution if applied to hemp, which could have created millions of jobs and helped bring america out of the great depression.",

                    "although there is considerable evidence that a subset of infants has an increased risk of sudden death after receiving vaccines, health authorities eliminated \"prophylactic vaccination\" as an official cause of death, so medical examiners are compelled to misclassify and conceal vaccine-related fatalities under alternate cause-of-death classifications. in this paper, the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) database was analyzed to ascertain the onset interval of infant deaths post-vaccination. of 2605 infant deaths reported to vaers from 1990 through 2019, 58 % clustered within 3 days post-vaccination and 78.3 % occurred within 7 days post-vaccination, confirming that infant deaths tend to occur in temporal proximity to vaccine administration. the excess of deaths during these early post-vaccination periods was statistically significant (p < 0.00001). a review of the medical literature substantiates a link between vaccines and sudden unexplained infant deaths. several theories regarding the pathogenic mechanism behind these fatal events have been proposed, including the role of inflammatory cytokines as neuromodulators in the infant medulla preceding an abnormal response to the accumulation of carbon dioxide; fatal disorganization of respiratory control induced by adjuvants that cross the blood-brain barrier; and biochemical or synergistic toxicity due to multiple vaccines administered concurrently. while the findings in this paper are not proof of an association between infant vaccines and infant deaths, they are highly suggestive of a causal relationship.",

                    "the reserve bank of india (rbi) decided to withdraw rs 2000 from circulation. as per the notification issued by the rbi, the rs 2,000 note is being taken out of circulation in pursuance of the clean note policy. the central bank has asked people to exchange or deposit the rs 2,000 note in banks by september 30, 2023. the rbi has stressed the fact that rs 2000 note continues to be a legal tender . this means that one can use the rs 2000 note for buying goods and services, in everyday life transactions etc. however, nothing is mentioned in the latest circular regarding what will happen if rs 2000 note is not exchanged or deposited in banks by the september 30 deadlinein a media interaction on may 22, 2023, rbi governor shaktikanta das said that procedural elements post-september 30, 2023 deadline or possible deadline extension will be taken based on the number of rs 2000 notes that come back from circulation.the rbi in its directive to all banks has said that the instructions for the modalities of exchange and deposit of rs 2000 note are effective till september 30, 2023. thus, one needs to await further instructions from rbi regarding what will happen to these notes from october 1, 2023.the rbi can provide a facility of exchange of rs 2000 notes even after september 30, 2023, via a new circular, if it deems fit, as it was done in the case of withdrawal of pre-2005 notes done in 2013-14 (as mentioned below).as of now, by virtue of being a legal tender, as stated by rbi, the rs 2000 notes can still be exchanged after 30 september 2023, at the specified rbi offices. that window is open for all, in case you miss depositing or exchanging at the bank.if rbi deems fit and issues an updated circular, it can allow an individual to deposit rs 2000 banknotes in their bank accounts, even after 30 sept 2023.also read: when can you deposit rs 2000 notes in bank? here are two instances of what happened in earlier times when rbi withdrew currency - notes and coins- from circulation.in 2013-14, the rbi decided to withdraw some banknotes issued prior to 2005 from circulation. this was done because such notes had fewer security features and new ones with better security features were available.the faqs issued by the rbi on indian currency (updated till may 17, 2022), state that the facility for exchange of pre-2005 notes is available in specified offices of rbi. however, this does not imply that banks cannot accept deposits of pre-2005 banknotes for crediting the money to the customers account. this has been reiterated by the rbi in a press release dated december 19, 2016.hence, going by rbis above-mentioned faqs, if an individual has an old pre-2005 bank note for a denomination of say rs 10, 50, or 100, then such notes can either be deposited in their bank accounts or exchanged at the specified rbi offices. however, do note that old rs 500 and rs 1000 notes can neither be exchanged nor deposited in the bank account. this is because these notes were demonetised and ceased to be legal tender from midnight of november 8, 2016.also read: is there a limit on amount of rs 2000 note that can be deposited, exchange? the central bank has done a similar exercise in the case of 25 paise coins. the same faqs as mentioned above state: twenty five paise coins were withdrawn from circulation with effect from june 30, 2011, andcoins of denominations below 25 paise were withdrawn from circulation much earlier. all other denominations of coins of various size, theme and design minted by government of india under the coinage act, 2011 and issued by rbi for circulation from time to time, continue to remain legal tender.as per the faqs, every banknote issued by reserve bank of india (rs 2, rs 5, rs 10, rs 20, rs 50, rs 100, rs 200, rs 500 and rs 2000), unless withdrawn from circulation, shall be legal tender at any place in india in payment or on account for the amount expressed therein, and shall be guaranteed by the central government, subject to provisions of sub-section (2) section 26 of rbi act, 1934.the press note issued by the rbi on may 19, 2023, says that though rs 2000 note is being withdrawn from circulation, it continues to be a legal tender. members of the public can continue to use rs 2000 banknotes for their transactions and also receive them in payment. however, theydeposit and/or exchange these banknotes on or before september 30, 2023, state the faqs issued for the deposit/exchange of rs 2000 notes.the language used by rbi encouraged to does not make it clear what will happen after september 30. in the two instances cited above, as per rbis own faqs while 25 paise coin is no longer legal tender, the pre-2005 banknotes continue to be so.also read: what will happen if bank spots fake rs 2000 note hence, it would be wise to follow the rbis guidelines and exchange/deposit rs 2000 notes in banks by september 30."

                    "texas has not expanded medicaid under the affordable care act (aca). as a result, texas has the biggest coverage gap in the country, with an estimated 772,000 residents ineligible for medicaid and also ineligible for premium subsidies to offset the cost of private coverage in the exchange. hhs reported that 45% of texas adults (age 19-64) with income under 138% of the poverty level were uninsured as of 2020, which was the highest level in the country (that population would become medicaid-eligible if texas were to expand medicaid). various sudies and reports show lagging health outcomes and a nationally high uninsured rate at least partly due to the decision against expanding medicaid in texas. by refusing medicaid expansion under the aca, texas has already missed out on billions in federal funding that would otherwise have flowed to the state to provide medical care for their low-income residents. and in addition, the states emergency rooms are providing $5.5 billion in uncompensated care each year, treating patients who dont have health insurance (as noted above, the state is receiving about $2.5 billion in annual federal funding to cover uncompensated care). if medicaid eligibility had been expanded, uncompensated care would have dropped considerably, so hospitals and business groups across the state have been pressuring lawmakers to relent on their opposition to medicaid expansion."

(the poverty threshold for a single person is $12,448. that number increases depending on how many children are in the family. the threshold for a family of five, for example, would be $30,170). in addition to household income, students also automatically qualify for free lunches if they come from a family already receiving food stamps."
